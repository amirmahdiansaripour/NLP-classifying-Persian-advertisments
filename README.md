# NLP-classifying-Persian-advertisments

In this project, a $\textbf{Naive Bayes Classifier}$ is trained on a large dataset containing magazine advertisements. The advertisements are in Persian and belong to four classes (Game, Health, Science, and Art). 

For pre-processing, the $\textbf{Hazm}$ library has been used. In addition, techniques such $\textbf{additive smoothing}$ and employing $\textbf{bigrams}$, used for more accurate predictions, are discussed.
